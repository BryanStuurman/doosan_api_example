# Doosan API example
A quick repo to test out their linux example main.cpp file

## this is a mess
all the files I needed have been copied out to the root directory. main.cpp has been modified to remove windows/vc++ library references, and XENOMAI references. One thread (the safety thread maybe? lookks for stops from the keyboard) died in the process and I wasn't keen on jamming it back in. maybe tomorrow after I crash the robot.

## why is it a mess
because I'm bad at cmake - I wanted it to work first and I can fix it later.
